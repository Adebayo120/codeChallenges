//You are given a set of jobs.
// Each job has a defined deadline and some profit associated with it.
// The profit of a job is given only when that job is completed within its deadline.
// Only one processor is available for processing all the jobs.
// Processor takes one unit of time to complete a job.
// How can the total profit be maximized if only one job can be completed at a time?
